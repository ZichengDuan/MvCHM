## Overview
We propose a new state-of-the-art method MvCHM for multiview object detection, and some major upgrades on existing multiview pedestrian detectiom benchmarks [Wildtrack](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-wildtrack/) dataset and [MultiviewX](https://github.com/hou-yz/MultiviewX) dataset, respectively named as Wildtrack+ and MultiviewX+.
